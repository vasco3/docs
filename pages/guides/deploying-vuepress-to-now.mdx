VuePress is a vue-powered static generator. It is used for generating static sites with a focus on writing.

This guide will cover how to create and deploy a VuePress application to ZEIT Now.

Already have a VuePress project? [Skip to deploying](#step-3:-deploy-vuepress-with-now)!

## Step 1: Getting Started with VuePress

The first step is to create a project and `cd` into it via your terminal.

<Snippet dark text="mkdir vuepress-project && cd vuepress-project" />

Next, install VuePress as a [local dev dependency](https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file). Use the following command:

<Snippet dark text="npm i -D vuepress" />

Once the dependencies are installed, create a `README.md` with the following contents:

```markdown
# Hello From Vuepress on Now 2.0!
```

Next, create a `guide` directory within the project and add a `README.md` file with the following code:

```markdown
# Guides

This page lists and describes your project with guides!
```

## Step 2: Configure and Run VuePress

We have created a few documentation files. Now, we are ready to configure VuePress.

With a few documentation pages created, you now need to configure VuePress.

Create a `.vuepress` folder inside the project directory with a `config.js` file and insert the following code:

```js
module.exports = {
  title: 'My VuePress Project',
  description: 'A simple VuePress project deployed with ZEIT Now.',
  themeConfig: {
    nav: [{ text: 'Home', link: '/' }, { text: 'Guide', link: '/guides/' }]
  },
  dest: 'public'
}
```

Next, add both a development and build script to the `package.json` file in the root project directory.

```js
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
      "dev": "vuepress dev",
      "build": "vuepress build"
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Deploy VuePress with Now

With your project set up, you are ready to deploy your VuePress app with [Now](/now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

You can deploy your VuePress application with **just a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

When your app is deployed, you will receive a deployment URL like the following: <https://vuepress-nv3m85eee.now.sh/>

If you want to deploy your VuePress project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and aliased on push to master.
