Angular is a popular JavaScript framework for building applications across all platforms; web, mobile web, native mobile, and native desktop.

In this guide, we will deploy an Angular application with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2) like the following: <https://tour-of-heroes-he3j9k80n.now.sh/>

## Step 1: Set Up Your Angular Project

The most straightforward way to set up an Angular project is to use the [official Angular CLI tool](https://angular.io/cli). The CLI tool interactively generates an Angular application that works out of the box.

If you don't have the Angular CLI installed globally, use the following command to install it:

<Snippet dark text="npm i -g @angular/cli" />
<Caption>Installing Angular CLI global to the system user with <GenericLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli">npm</GenericLink>.</Caption>

Once the installation is complete, run the following command in your terminal to create a new Angular app:

<Snippet dark text="ng new my-new-app" />
<Caption>Creating a new Angular application within a terminal.</Caption>

Once you run the command, the Angular CLI presents the following options:

- Adding Angular Routing to the project.
- The Stylesheet format to add to the project: `css`, `sass`, `less`, `stylus`.

For the first option, if you choose `Yes`, the CLI tool adds [routing](https://angular.io/guide/router) automatically to the project. Then, you can select your preferred stylesheet format for the second option. Once selected, Angular CLI provides the selected stylesheet format for the project.

After a successful scaffolding, `cd` into `my-new-app` directory and run the following command to serve your app in the browser:

<Snippet dark text="ng serve --open" />
<Caption>Running your Angular application locally</Caption>

Your browser will automatically be launched with the served Angular app at <http://localhost:4200/>

## Step 2: Deploy Your Angular Project with Now

With your Angular application set up, it is ready to deploy live with [Now](/docs/v2).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

With Now installed, you can deploy your Angular project with **just a single command**.

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want your app to deploy automatically, you can install either the [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) apps, this will provide you with unique deployments for your Git repository on every push.

When your app is deployed, you will receive a deployment URL similar to the one shown at the beginning of this guide: <https://tour-of-heroes-he3j9k80n.now.sh/>
