[ZEIT Now](/now) supports configuration required to ignore source files and paths within your project. With a `.nowignore` file in your project directory, a source path can be prevented from being uploaded to Now.

## File Syntax

The syntax of a `.nowignore` file matches that of the popular [`.gitignore` file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format) used in ignoring files when uploading to a Git repository.

An example of a `.nowignore` file that prevents an `/image` directory and `/private.html` file within a project from being uploaded to ZEIT Now would look like this:

```
image
private.html
```

## Uploaded Files

Aside from the [default exclusions](/docs/v2/build-step/#ignored-files-and-folders), all files within your project are uploaded to ZEIT Now if no source path is specified to be excluded in a [`.nowignore` configuration file](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/ignoring-source-paths).

<Note hint>
  You can find the complete list of files and directories excluded by default in

  .
</Note>

Worthy of note is that not all uploaded files are served on ZEIT Now. So, what files are served?

## Served Files

If [ZEIT Now](/now) is required to build your project, the non-targeted files are prevented from being deployed and served on ZEIT Now.

The use of a [`.nowignore` configuration file](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/deployments/ignoring-source-paths) allows you to keep private files safe and also makes your deployment faster by uploading only the essential files.
