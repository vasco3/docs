[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for developing JavaScript UI components in isolation.

In this guide, we will cover how to set up a Svelte Storybook component library application with [Storybook CLI](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/lib/cli) and how to deploy it with [ZEIT Now](/now).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Storybook Project

Get started by creating and moving into a `/svelte-stories` directory, then initializing the project:

<Snippet dark text="mkdir svelte-stories && cd svelte-stories && npm init -y" />

Next, use the [Storybook CLI](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/lib/cli) to bootstrap the project, providing an initial setup to work from:

<Snippet dark text="npx -p @storybook/cli sb init --type svelte" />

Now, add `@storybook/svelte`, `@babel/core`, and `babel-loader` as development dependencies:

<Snippet dark text="npm i -D @storybook/svelte @babel/core babel-loader" />
<Caption>Adding <InlineCode>@storybook/svelte</InlineCode>, <InlineCode>@babel/core</InlineCode>, and <InlineCode>babel-loader</InlineCode> to the project as a development dependencies.</Caption>

With the development dependencies added, extend your `package.json` file by adding the scripts below:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "storybook": "start-storybook",
    "build": "build-storybook -c .storybook -o public"
  }
}
```

  scripts to the <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file.

By adding these scripts you are able to start a development server from inside your project directory with `npm storybook`. You are also able to deploy the Storybook component library with [ZEIT Now](/now) with no additional configuration.

## Step 2: Deploying with ZEIT Now

With your project set up, you are ready to deploy your Storybook component library with [ZEIT Now](/now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

You can now deploy your Storybook component library with **just a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want to deploy your Storybook component library from a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/advanced/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/advanced/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and aliased on push to master.
