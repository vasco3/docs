[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) is a popular front-end framework that helps you create static apps and websites with React.

In this guide, we will show how you can set up your Gatsby project and deploy with Now in a few moments.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Gatsby Project

If you have not already [set up a Gatsby project](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start) you can do so by first installing Gatsby CLI globally from your terminal:

<Snippet dark text="npm i -g gatsby-cli" />

Then you can run the following command to create a Gatsby project locally:

<Snippet dark text="gatsby new my-gatsby-project" />

Next, move into the directory from your terminal with `cd my-gatsby-project`. You can see your new project in a local development environment by using the `npm develop` command, set in the `package.json` by Gatsby CLI.

## Step 2: Deploying Your Gatsby Website

With a Gatsby application set up, it is ready to deploy live with [Now](/docs/v2).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

Now allows you to [deploy your project](/docs/v2/deployments/basics) from the terminal with **just a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

If you want to deploy your Gatsby project when you push to a Git repository, you can use either [Now for GitHub](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-github/) or [Now for GitLab](/docs/v2/integrations/now-for-gitlab/) to have your project automatically deployed on every push, and aliased on push to master.
