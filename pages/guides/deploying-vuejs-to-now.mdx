Vue.js is an open source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is popularly known for its gentle learning curve and is adopted by a lot of developers for crafting single-page applications (SPAs) globally.

In this guide, we will cover how to deploy a Vue.js application with [ZEIT Now](/docs/v2).

## Step 1: Set Up Your Vue.js Project

First, set up a Vue.js project using the [official Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) to quickly scaffold a batteries-included Vue.js SPA.

If you don't have the Vue CLI installed globally, use the following command to install it globally:

<Snippet dark text="npm i -g @vue/cli" />

After a successful installation, create a new project and `cd` into the project folder. Use the following command in your terminal to do so:

<Snippet dark text="vue create vue-project && cd vue-project" />

An option to choose a preset will be presented to you after running the command above.

After choosing an option, Vue CLI installs all the required dependencies and provisions a new project for you.

Next, to extend the project with client-side routing; install the [official Vue.js router](https://router.vuejs.org/) by running the following command in your terminal:

<Snippet dark text="vue add router" />

Vue CLI adds the router to the project and automatically updates the project files with basic routing functionality.

## Step 2: Deploying with Now

With your project set up, you are ready to deploy your Vue.js app with [Now](/now).

If you have not yet installed Now, you can do so by [installing Now CLI](/download).

You can deploy your Vue.js application with **just a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />

Once the app is deployed, you will receive a deployment URL similar to the following: <https://my-vue-project-ro3oxryae.now.sh/>

You can see that routes were successful by going to the generated `/about` route directly: <https://my-vue-project-ro3oxryae.now.sh/about>
